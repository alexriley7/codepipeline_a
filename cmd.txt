--Flask app is running on port 5000

git remote add origin git@github.com:alexriley7/codepipeline_a.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

I've used old token with secrets manager ( github-token1 )

cdk bootstrap aws://456582263462/us-east-1


Fix import file routes, commit and do npm run build to test

deleted network stack and app stack, start from docker-ecr

what happen to source action and codestar connection using arn? can i push and see the changes anyway?


app-repo1 is empty, app image was automatically pushed to aws repo named cdk-hnb659fds-container-assets-456582263462-us-east-1

maybe cdk synth fails if more than 1 non pipeline code staged declared file is present on /lib folder
